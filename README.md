## Artwork Archive

### **!!! Work in progress - not ready for use!!!**

### Overview

Artwork Archive is a lightweight desktop app for artists, galleries and
collectors who need to store, organize and browse their artwork database.
It offers a table-based view, fast filtering, a simple form for adding works,
local SQLite storage, PDF export and optional image thumbnails.

### Technical Overview

The app is built with PySide6 and uses QTableView with a QSortFilterProxyModel
for sorting and live filtering. Data is stored in a local SQLite database created
on first launch. The UI includes dynamic table rows, input forms for CRUD operations
and basic file selection for thumbnails. The project structure is intentionally
minimal to highlight GUI logic and data flow.

### Testing and QA Scope

This project is also part of my QA portfolio and includes user stories, functional
test cases, exploratory testing notes, bug reports and automated tests created during
development. It is meant to demonstrate practical testing techniques on a real application,
covering GUI behavior, CRUD operations, data validation, filtering logic and database
interactions.
